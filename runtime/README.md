# Runtime storage

This directory groups all runtime artifacts generated by the agent loop. Each subdirectory is created automatically when the agent initializes its `StateStore` and is kept here (instead of the repository root) to avoid cluttering the top level.

- `ideas/`: Append-only JSONL log of generated ideas.
- `iterations/`: Timestamped iteration logs that capture prompts, responses, and task outcomes.
- `snapshots/`: Human-readable snapshots collected during longer runs.
- `state/`: Task queue, iteration counters, and idea history metadata.

You can override the storage root with the `--base-dir` flag in the CLI if you prefer a different location.
